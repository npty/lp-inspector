Hi,
I do not know how to contact you, so I am creating this PR as a communication mean.
Thanks a lot for this project, given the MasterChef, it allows me to understand a lot on how the pools are handled.
I am trying to list all the MasterChef addresses, and therefore ask the community to add/update the following repo: How much is my LP worth?

=> what do you think of using the jsons provided as a input for you? 

regards
